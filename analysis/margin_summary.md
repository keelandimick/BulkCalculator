# Bulk Calculator Pricing Margin Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the profitability impact of changing from the current bulk discount tiers (50+ unit minimum) to proposed new tiers (1+ unit minimum with more aggressive discounts).

## Products Analyzed

1. **CF-U-58X28** (Coffee table) - Retail: $479.99, Cost: $240.96
2. **D-U-46X24** (Desk) - Retail: $359.99, Cost: $184.02  
3. **DN-U-60X36** (Dining table) - Retail: $599.99, Cost: $323.71

## Current vs Proposed Discount Structures

### Current Tiers (50+ unit minimum)
- 50-99 units: 10% discount
- 100-199 units: 15% discount
- 200-299 units: 20% discount
- 300-499 units: 25% discount
- 500+ units: 30% discount

### Proposed Tiers (1+ unit minimum)
- 1-10 units: 10% discount
- 11-20 units: 20% discount
- 21+ units: 30% discount

## Key Findings

### 1. Small Orders (1-20 units)
**Current System:** No bulk discounts, margins ~35-40%
**Proposed System:** 10-20% discounts immediately applied

**Impact:**
- **5 units:** Margin drops 6-7%, profit loss $200-250 per order
- **10 units:** Margin drops 6-7%, profit loss $300-500 per order
- **15 units:** Margin drops 14-15%, profit loss $900-1,500 per order
- **20 units:** Margin drops 14-15%, profit loss $1,200-2,000 per order

### 2. Medium Orders (21-49 units)
**Current System:** No bulk discounts
**Proposed System:** 30% discount (maximum tier)

**Impact:**
- **25 units:** Margin drops 24-26%, profit loss $2,300-3,800 per order
- Proposed system gives maximum discount to orders that previously got none

### 3. Large Orders (50+ units)
**Current System:** Tiered discounts based on quantity
**Proposed System:** Flat 30% discount for all

**Impact:**
- **50 units:** Margin drops 18-20%, profit loss $3,100-5,100 per order
- **100 units:** Margin drops 14-16%, profit loss $4,700-7,700 per order
- Orders get maximum discount earlier than current system

## Financial Impact Examples

### Annual Impact Scenarios

Assuming 100 orders per year with average order size:

**Small Orders (10 units average):**
- Current profit per order: ~$1,300
- Proposed profit per order: ~$950
- Annual profit loss: $35,000

**Medium Orders (25 units average):**
- Current profit per order: ~$4,200
- Proposed profit per order: ~$1,100
- Annual profit loss: $310,000

**Large Orders (100 units average):**
- Current profit per order: ~$10,000
- Proposed profit per order: ~$4,500
- Annual profit loss: $550,000

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Current Tier Structure**
   - Protects margins on smaller orders
   - Encourages larger bulk purchases
   - Maintains profitability across all order sizes

2. **If New Tiers Are Required, Consider:**
   - Implementing minimum order quantities (e.g., 25 units)
   - Reducing discount percentages (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15% instead of 10%, 20%, 30%)
   - Adding shipping/freight surcharges for small orders
   - Creating separate pricing for true wholesale accounts

3. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Volume-based annual commitments for better pricing
   - Tiered pricing based on customer type (retail vs wholesale)
   - Seasonal promotions instead of permanent discount changes

## Conclusion

The proposed tier changes would significantly reduce profitability, particularly on orders under 50 units. The current system better balances customer incentives with business margins. Any changes should carefully consider the impact on overall profitability and potentially include safeguards like minimum order quantities.
