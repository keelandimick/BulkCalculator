IMPLICATIONS FOR B2B PRICING
----------------------------
The $361.24 average freight cost creates a significant fixed cost that must be 
distributed across the order quantity. This makes MOQ critical for maintaining margins.

Freight Cost Impact by Order Size:
- 25 units: $14.45/unit (59% of total cost at $10 product cost)
- 50 units: $7.22/unit (42% of total cost)
- 100 units: $3.61/unit (27% of total cost) ← RECOMMENDED MINIMUM
- 200 units: $1.81/unit (15% of total cost)
- 500 units: $0.72/unit (7% of total cost)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Set minimum MOQ at 100 units to keep freight manageable
2. Implement tiered pricing to incentivize larger orders
3. Consider freight-included pricing for simplicity
4. Offer free freight threshold at $2,000-2,500
5. Provide custom quotes for very large orders (1000+ units)

- Highest weekly LTL total: $2,598.03 (week 5_5)
